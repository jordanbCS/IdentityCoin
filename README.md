SBTs would represent a person's reputation and accomplishments, a kind of "extended resume," Buterin wrote. The idea is to bolster people's social identities by customizing them with unique, non-exchangeable badges. In theory, the tokens could help solve some of the problems ravaging decentralized finance, like scams and theft." ... "A person's SBTs would then be validated by other "souls," or people who can vouch for you and the credential or accomplishment you're earning a token for, similar to how a LinkedIn connection can verify a skill of yours." - paper: "Weyl, Eric Glen and Ohlhaver, Puja and Buterin, Vitalik, Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul (May 10, 2022).
